I want to create a chrome browser extension that allows me to click on the icon in the extension toolbard and 'copy as markdown' the current page. I'd also like to be able to select text and right-click and have an option to 'copy as markdown (selection)' or just generally right-click on the page and have 'copy as markdown (full page)'.

I believe this should be relatively straightforward - the document obj can return the site's HTLM and there are plenty of node packages that convert HTML to markdown.

I'm adding context7 MCP for library discovery / usage patterns.
