**Last Updated: January 2025**

## Overview

Chrome Markdownify is committed to protecting your privacy. This extension converts web pages to Markdown format entirely within your browser. We do not collect, store, or transmit any of your personal data or browsing information.

## Data Collection

**We do not collect any data.** Specifically:

## Data Processing

All processing happens locally in your browser:

- ✅ Converted content is only stored in your clipboard when you request it
- ✅ Downloaded files are saved directly to your local device
